              Spencer was founded in November of 2020, in an attempt to make one
              bot for everything. We are still waiting on a few features though
              ðŸ˜‰.

              FAST
            </h3>
            <p class="leading-relaxed text-base text-black">
              Spencer is fast, very fast, extremely fast, fast fast. Did we say
              fast? We mean very fast. You get the idea, we are constantly
              trying to improve Spencer with performance upgrades, not to
              mention all the new features though!
